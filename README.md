# Defining structure and qsort() function in C

This program shows how to create record and sort different types of data. 
In structure we have 3 variables:
1. name
2. score
3. wins
   
Which we should write with semicolon instead of spaces to be able to sort it

## Example of input:
```bash
5
Gryffindor;220;2
Slytherin;220;1
Hufflepuff;180;0
Ravenclaw;180;0
CustomHouse;10;0
